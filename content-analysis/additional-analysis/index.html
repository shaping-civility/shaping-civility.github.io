					<h3>Average Marginal Effects</h3>
					<p>
						The following table shows the corresponding average marginal effects of all independent variables, controlling for all other variables in the model. It makes plain that the largest differences in the expected probability of outrage occur in the lower two categories. The main difference across political systems, degrees of socio-cultural division, and especially media types occurs with respect to whether "no outrage" or "slight outrage" occurs. Average effects for political system, societal division and media type are essentially nil for the higher outrage categories (i.e., "moderate" to “very strong” outrage).

					<h3>Predictive Margins</h3>
					<p>
						The figure below displays the marginal predicted mean probabilities for actor references to contain recognition or outrage. These probabilities imply the average treatment effect (AME) of each independent variable relative to the relevant reference category (see table above). The upper row of plots shows that the type of political system did not have an effect on the average probability of actor references to contain explicit recognition, with neither mixed (AME = -.00, 95% CI = [-.03, .03]) nor majoritarian systems (AME = -.02, 95% CI = [-.05, .01]) differing from the consensus systems. Conversely, actors in countries divided about public secularism were three percentage points more likely to engage in acts of explicit recognition than in countries characterized by a stable secular consensus (middle plot, AME = .03, 95% CI = [.01, .05]). Similarly, the right-hand plot in the upper row illustrates how both news websites (AME = .02, 95% CI = [.00, .04]) and newspapers (AME = .04, 95% CI = [.02, .06]) are more likely to feature actor references containing explicit recognition than blogs. While the proportion of recognition-containing between-actor references, unsurprisingly, is low overall, the contrasts of marginal recognition probabilities between divided and non-divided societies and between non-professional and professional media are statistically significant.

						The lower row of plots shows the average probability of actor references to contain outrage. Just as for recognition, the first (left-hand) plot shows that the type of political system did not matter for outrage on the actor-reference level, with neither mixed (AME = .03, 95% CI = [-.00, .06]) nor majoritarian systems (AME = -.01, 95% CI = [-.04, .02]) exhibiting a significant deviation from their consensus counterparts. Unlike for recognition, this is also true for the contrast between mediated actors in non-divided versus divided countries (middle plot, AME = -.00, 95% CI = [-.02, .01]). However, the right-hand plot of predicted outrage probabilities shows a reversed image compared to findings on recognition: both news websites (AME = -.05, 95% CI = [-.07, -.02]) and newspapers (AME = -.04, 95% CI = [-.06, -.01]) are significantly less likely to present actor-reference level outrage than blogs. Just as with recognition, the proportion of outrage-containing actor references is low overall as expected, yet contrasting the marginal predicted probabilities of outrage across categories of our independent variables shows that the difference between non-professional and professional media is considerable, with professional news media significantly less likely to feature actors engaging in acts of outrage compared with blogs as the less professional under study here.
